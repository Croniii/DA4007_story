# A DA4007 fairytale
Once upon a time, by a lake called Brunnsviken, there was an old castle made of yellow bricks.
The leaves were falling.
Frost on the ground.
People are still swimming in the lake.

On a cold autumn day, a queen opened the castle window and birds flew in.

More animals apart from the birds came inside the castle through open doors-deers, rabbits, .... .
